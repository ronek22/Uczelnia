blow and did you know your stair
way lies on the whispering wind 
and as we wind on down the road 
our shadows taller than our soul
 there walks a lady we all know 
who shines white light and wants
 to show how everything still tu
rns to gold and if you listen ve
ry hard the tune will come to yo
u at last when all are one and o
ne is all to be a rock and not t
